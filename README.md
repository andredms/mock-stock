A fake stock market which utilises Python, SQLite and Selenium. Allows users to invest into the ASX without the risk of losing any money. Scrapes the ASX through a Chrome web-driver, getting real-time increases/decreases and stores all investor data within a database which the user can query through various commands. The market is open on weekdays 8am - 2pm (WAST) and closes on weekends, users can still invest and use the bot outside of these hours, however their profits won't go up until the market re-opens. 

Ideal for a Discord server as it allows users to compete with friends. There's also a simple CLI version (not uploaded) if you want to run solo. Leaderboards and 24/7 hosting coming soon!
