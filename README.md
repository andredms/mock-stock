A fake stock market which utilises Python, SQLite and Selenium. Allows users to invest into the ASX without the risk of losing any money. Scrapes the ASX through a Chrome web-driver, getting real-time increases/decreases and stores all investor data within a database which the user can query through various commands. The market is open on weekdays 5am - 3pm (WAST) and closes on weekends, users can still invest and use the bot outside of these hours, however their profits won't go up until the market re-opens. 

Ideal for a Discord server as it allows users to compete with friends. There's also a simple CLI version if you want to run solo. Leaderboards and 24/7 hosting coming soon!

## Usage

All users inititally start out with $500 spending cash, they can invest this and then sell their stocks to earn more money. 

#### View Profile

This command brings up how much a user is worth, the profit they've made on the ASX, their invested companies and an embeded graph of their profits over time. Graph is scheduled to update every 24 hours.

#### Invest
